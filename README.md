# Swypex Task

## Why I've used This Tech Stack?
- <b>Vite</b>: for quick start and because everything in this project is Client side and Vite is better than create-react-app as React team recommend(despite the argument between Dan Abramov and Evan You)
- <b>Tailwind CSS</b>: I think it's the best CSS framework outthere and for productivity reasons.
- <b>Shadcn</b>: For faster Development and it's not a UI component it's just "It's a collection of re-usable components" 

## Usage
- Clone the repo <code>git clone https://github.com/eslamheshamm/swypex-task</code>
- Install the dependencies: <code>npm install</code>
- Start the development server: <code>npm run dev</code>

### Thank you!
